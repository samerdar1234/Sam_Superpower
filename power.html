        <!-- My backstory -->
        <div>
            <h3><i>The Beginnings...</i></h3>
            <q><i>Not just your average superhero</i></q>
            <p>Now this is a story all about how, statistics got flipped
            turned upside down. I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there. 
            I'll tell you how I became the outlier of Saline.</p>
            <p>Walking down the aisle of Walmart's parking lot, I could feel the 
            hush of normalicy cross the sky. As if fate had been determined, a 
            radioactive flying book came shooting towards me. I tried to run. 
            The bell curves overtook me though, and I couldn't escape the statistical
            chance that I had to become the owner of all opportunities. I blacked out from
            the blow of that book. When I woke up, the radioactive statistics book was gone, 
            but the ability to point and change the likelihood of anything happening was left behind. </p>

        <p>The concept of my powers is this: I can control the probability
        of things happening. </p>

        <!-- My limitations -->
        <h3><i>Too much of a good thing...</i></h3>
        <p>For all superheros, there is a limit. Nothing in life has 
        a completely determined outcome and there is nothing I can 
        do to make fate certain. I can range the probability of things
        happening between 20%-80%. There is always the likihood that 
        things don't turn out how I plan or things only turn out 80% how
        I want, but that's where the human portion of me adapts and overcomes.</p>
        <p>Another unfortunate thing is that if an outcome already had a 0.01% chance of
        happening, I may have altered it to have a 20% chance of happening instead. Beware friends,
        the likihood of getting killed by a cow is low, but never zero...</p>
